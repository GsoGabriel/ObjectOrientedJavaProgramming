# Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond 

### Descrição do programa retirado do próprio site (tradução livre):

Essa especialização cobre tópicos intermediários sobre desenvolvimento de software. Você aprenderá Princípios de Programação orientada a objetos que permitirão que você use o Java em seu potencial máximo, e você implementará estrutura de dados e algoritimos para organização de grandes arquivos de data de modo que seja tanto eficiente quanto fácil trabalhar com eles. Você também fará avaliações críticas de seu próprio código, e desenvolverá habilidades técnicas de comunicação que irão te ajudar no preparo de entrevistas de emprego e trabalhos colaborativos como um engenheiro de software. No projeto de conclusão do curso, você aplicará suas habilidades para analisar dados coletados de uma rede (social) do mundo real. Google tem contribuido com projetos do mundo real e o envolvimento de seus engenheiros como palestrantes convidados para esses cursos.

### Description of the course program taken from the website:

This Specialization covers intermediate topics in software development. You’ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, and you’ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with. You’ll also practice critically evaluating your own code, and you’ll build technical communication skills that will help you prepare for job interviews and collaborative work as a software engineer. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to analyze data collected from a real-world (social) network. Google has contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to these courses. 

### Week 1
#### After completing this course, you will be able to...
1. Describe the difference between an abstract data type (ADT) and its implementation.
2. Work with Java's built-in classes for fundamental data structures including: String, LinkedList, TreeSet, HashSet, and HashMap.
3. Implement fundamental data structures from scratch including Linked Lists and Tries (yes, we mean Tries rather than trees ... stay tuned to learn about this data structure!).
4. Analyze the performance of code, using Big-O notation as well as through benchmarking experiments.
5. Compare and contrast the performance of different data structures to select the most appropriate for a task.
6. Write JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
7. Implement several algorithms for generating and processing text.

### Week 2

#### By the end of this week, you will be able to...
1. Describe how the Flesch Readability Score can be used to determine the readability of text
2. Describe how Strings are represented in Java
3. Perform basic operations with Strings in Java
4. Work with the String class's built-in methods to manipulate Strings
5. Write regular expressions to match String patterns
6. Use regular expressions to split strings
