### Week 1

#### After completing this course, you will be able to...

1. Describe the difference between an abstract data type (ADT) and its implementation.
2. Work with Java's built-in classes for fundamental data structures including: String, LinkedList, TreeSet, HashSet, and HashMap.
3. Implement fundamental data structures from scratch including Linked Lists and Tries (yes, we mean Tries rather than trees ... stay tuned to learn about this data structure!).
4. Analyze the performance of code, using Big-O notation as well as through benchmarking experiments.
5. Compare and contrast the performance of different data structures to select the most appropriate for a task.
6. Write JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
7. Implement several algorithms for generating and processing text.
